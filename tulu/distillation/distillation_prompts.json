  "Polar bears like unique arrays — that is, arrays without repeated elements.\n\nYou have got a unique array s with length n containing non-negative integers. Since you are good friends with Alice and Bob, you decide to split the array in two. Precisely, you need to construct two arrays a and b that are also of length n, with the following conditions for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ n):\n\n  * ai, bi are non-negative integers; \n  * si = ai + bi . \n\n\n\nIdeally, a and b should also be unique arrays. However, life in the Arctic is hard and this is not always possible. Fortunately, Alice and Bob are still happy if their arrays are almost unique. We define an array of length n to be almost unique, if and only if it can be turned into a unique array by removing no more than <image> entries.\n\nFor example, the array [1, 2, 1, 3, 2] is almost unique because after removing the first two entries, it becomes [1, 3, 2]. The array [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2] is not almost unique because we need to remove at least 3 entries to turn it into a unique array.\n\nSo, your task is to split the given unique array s into two almost unique arrays a and b.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).\n\nThe second line contains n distinct integers s1, s2, ... sn (0 ≤ si ≤ 109).\n\nOutput\n\nIf it is possible to make Alice and Bob happy (if you can split the given array), print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line, print the array a. In the third line, print the array b. There may be more than one solution. Any of them will be accepted.\n\nIf it is impossible to split s into almost unique arrays a and b, print \"NO\" (without quotes) in the first line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n6\n12 5 8 3 11 9\n\n\nOutput\n\nYES\n6 2 6 0 2 4\n6 3 2 3 9 5\n\nNote\n\nIn the sample, we can remove the first two entries from a and the second entry from b to make them both unique.",

  "A plane contains a not necessarily convex polygon without self-intersections, consisting of n vertexes, numbered from 1 to n. There is a spider sitting on the border of the polygon, the spider can move like that:\n\n  1. Transfer. The spider moves from the point p1 with coordinates (x1, y1), lying on the polygon border, to the point p2 with coordinates (x2, y2), also lying on the border. The spider can't go beyond the polygon border as it transfers, that is, the spider's path from point p1 to point p2 goes along the polygon border. It's up to the spider to choose the direction of walking round the polygon border (clockwise or counterclockwise). \n  2. Descend. The spider moves from point p1 with coordinates (x1, y1) to point p2 with coordinates (x2, y2), at that points p1 and p2 must lie on one vertical straight line (x1 = x2), point p1 must be not lower than point p2 (y1 ≥ y2) and segment p1p2 mustn't have points, located strictly outside the polygon (specifically, the segment can have common points with the border). \n\n\n\nInitially the spider is located at the polygon vertex with number s.

  "Julia is conducting an experiment in her lab. She placed several luminescent bacterial colonies in a horizontal testtube. Different types of bacteria can be distinguished by the color of light they emit. Julia marks types of bacteria with small Latin letters \"a\", ..., \"z\".\n\nThe testtube is divided into n consecutive regions. Each region is occupied by a single colony of a certain bacteria type at any given moment. Hence, the population of the testtube at any moment can be described by a string of n Latin characters.\n\nSometimes a colony can decide to conquer another colony in one of the adjacent regions. When that happens, the attacked colony is immediately eliminated and replaced by a colony of the same type as the attacking colony, while the attacking colony keeps its type. Note that a colony can only attack its neighbours within the boundaries of the testtube. At any moment, at most one attack can take place.\n\nFor example, consider a testtube with population \"babb\". There are six options for an attack that may happen next:\n\n  * the first colony attacks the second colony (1 → 2), the resulting population is \"bbbb\";\n  * 2 → 1, the result is \"aabb\";\n  * 2 → 3, the result is \"baab\";\n  * 3 → 2, the result is \"bbbb\" (note that the result is the same as the first option);\n  * 3 → 4 or 4 → 3, the population does not change.\n\n\n\nThe pattern of attacks is rather unpredictable.

  "Once Bob saw a string. It contained so many different letters, that the letters were marked by numbers, but at the same time each letter could be met in the string at most 10 times.

Besides, at the one hand, they want the participants to walk about the city and see the neighbourhood (that's why the distance between v and u should be no less than l). On the other hand, they don't want the participants to freeze (so the distance between v and u should be no more than r). Besides, for every street we know its beauty — some integer from 0 to 109.

  "Monocarp is playing a game \"Assimilation IV\". In this game he manages a great empire: builds cities and conquers new lands.\n\nMonocarp's empire has n cities. In order to conquer new lands he plans to build one Monument in each city. The game is turn-based and, since Monocarp is still amateur, he builds exactly one Monument per turn.\n\nMonocarp has m points on the map he'd like to control using the constructed Monuments. For each point he knows the distance between it and each city. Monuments work in the following way: when built in some city, a Monument controls all points at distance at most 1 to this city. Next turn, the Monument controls all points at distance at most 2, the turn after — at distance at most 3, and so on. Monocarp will build n Monuments in n turns and his empire will conquer all points that are controlled by at least one Monument.\n\nMonocarp can't figure out any strategy, so during each turn he will choose a city for a Monument randomly among all remaining cities (cities without Monuments). Monocarp wants to know how many points (among m of them) he will conquer at the end of turn number n.

  "Drazil likes heap very much. So he created a problem with heap:\n\nThere is a max heap with a height h implemented on the array. The details of this heap are the following:\n\nThis heap contains exactly 2^h - 1 distinct positive non-zero integers. All integers are distinct. These numbers are stored in the array a indexed from 1 to 2^h-1. For any 1 < i < 2^h, a[i] < a[\\left ⌊{i/2}\\right ⌋].\n\nNow we want to reduce the height of this heap such that the height becomes g with exactly 2^g-1 numbers in heap. To reduce the height, we should perform the following action 2^h-2^g times:\n\nChoose an index i, which contains an element and call the following function f in index i:\n\n<image>\n\nNote that we suppose that if a[i]=0, then index i don't contain an element.\n\nAfter all operations, the remaining 2^g-1 element must be located in indices from 1 to 2^g-1. Now Drazil wonders what's the minimum possible sum of the remaining 2^g-1 elements. Please find this sum and find a sequence of the function calls to achieve this value.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 70 000): the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case contain two lines.

However fox Swiper wants to spoil his plan.\n\nThe Swiper knows, that Dora now is only able to count up to 3, so he has came up with a following idea. He wants to steal some non-empty set of vertices, so that the Dora won't notice the loss. He has decided to steal some non-empty set of vertices, so that after deletion of the stolen vertices and edges adjacent to them, every remaining vertex wouldn't change it's degree modulo 3. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges it is adjacent to. It would've been suspicious to steal all the vertices, so Swiper needs another plan.\n\nBoots are sure, that the crime can not be allowed.

  "This problem is different with hard version only by constraints on total answers length\n\nIt is an interactive problem\n\nVenya joined a tour to the madhouse, in which orderlies play with patients the following game. Orderlies pick a string s of length n, consisting only of lowercase English letters. The player can ask two types of queries: \n\n  * ? l r – ask to list all substrings of s[l..r]. Substrings will be returned in random order, and in every substring, all characters will be randomly shuffled. \n  * ! s – guess the string picked by the orderlies. This query can be asked exactly once, after that the game will finish. If the string is guessed correctly, the player wins, otherwise he loses. \n\n\n\nThe player can ask no more than 3 queries of the first type.\n\nTo make it easier for the orderlies, there is an additional limitation: the total number of returned substrings in all queries of the first type must not exceed (n+1)^2.\n\nVenya asked you to write a program, which will guess the string by interacting with the orderlies' program and acting by the game's rules.\n\nYour program should immediately terminate after guessing the string using a query of the second type. In case your program guessed the string incorrectly, or it violated the game rules, it will receive verdict Wrong answer.\n\nNote that in every test case the string is fixed beforehand and will not change during the game, which means that the interactor is not adaptive.\nInput\n\nFirst line contains number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the picked string.\n\nInteraction\n\nYou start the interaction by reading the number n.\n\nTo ask a query about a substring from l to r inclusively (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), you should output\n\n? l r\n\non a separate line. After this, all substrings of s[l..r] will be returned in random order, each substring exactly once. In every returned substring all characters will be randomly shuffled.\n\nIn the case, if you ask an incorrect query, ask more than 3 queries of the first type or there will be more than (n+1)^2 substrings returned in total, you will receive verdict Wrong answer.\n\nTo guess the string s, you should output\n\n! s\n\non a separate line.\n\nAfter printing each query, do not forget to flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To flush the output, you can use: \n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * see documentation for other languages. \n\n\n\nIf you received - (dash) as an answer to any query, you need to terminate your program with exit code 0 (for example, by calling exit(0)). This means that there was an error in the interaction protocol. If you don't terminate with exit code 0, you can receive any unsuccessful verdict.\n\nHack format\n\nTo hack a solution, use the following format:\n\nThe first line should contain one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the string, and the following line should contain the string s.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n\na\naa\na\n\ncb\nb\nc\n\nc\n\nOutput\n\n\n? 1 2\n\n? 3 4\n\n? 4 4\n\n! aabc",

  "Alice and Bob play a game on a grid with n rows and infinitely many columns. In each row, there are three tokens, blue, white and red one.

Second, the starting player is chosen and makes his or her first turn. Then players take alternating turns. The player who is unable to make a move loses. \n\nDuring a move, a player first selects an integer k that is either a prime number or a product of two (not necessarily distinct) primes. The smallest possible values of k are thus 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, .... Furthermore, k must not be equal to the previously picked integer f. Each turn, a move is performed in exactly one of the rows.\n\nIf it is Alice's turn, she chooses a single blue token and moves it k cells to the right. Alternatively, she may move both the blue and the white token in the same row by the same amount k to the right.\n\nOn the other hand, Bob selects a single red token and moves it k cells to the left. Similarly, he may also move the white and the red token in the corresponding row by k to the left.\n\nNote that Alice may never move a red token, while Bob may never move a blue one.

Regardless of what Bob does, Alice will have one more move and then the game is over. For instance, he can move both the red and white token by 2 cells to the left, reaching state 2~3~7. Alice can then move blue and white token by 2 to move into 4~5~7, where no more moves are possible.\n\nIf Bob starts, he gains enough advantage to win. For instance, he may move the red token by 3 to the left, getting into position 0~3~6. Alice can, for example, move the blue token by 2, which is countered by Bob by moving the red token by 2. The game ends in position 2~3~4. \n\nIn the second example, it is forbidden to move by 2, but this doesn't stop Alice from winning! She can move the blue and white token by 4, getting into position 4~7~9. Now Bob has no move, since moving by 2 is forbidden.",
  "This is an interactive problem.\n\nMisha likes to play cooperative games with incomplete information. Today he suggested ten his friends to play a cooperative game \"Lake\".\n\nMisha has already come up with a field for the upcoming game. The field for this game is a directed graph consisting of two parts. The first part is a road along the coast of the lake which is a cycle of c vertices. The second part is a path from home to the lake which is a chain of t vertices, and there is an edge from the last vertex of this chain to the vertex of the road along the coast which has the most beautiful view of the lake, also known as the finish vertex. Misha decided to keep the field secret, so nobody knows neither t nor c.\n\n<image>\n\nNote that each vertex of the field has exactly one outgoing edge and all the vertices except the home vertex and the finish vertex have exactly one ingoing edge. The home vertex has no incoming edges, the finish vertex has two incoming edges.\n\nAt the beginning of the game pieces of all the ten players, indexed with consecutive integers from 0 to 9, are at the home vertex. After that on each turn some of the players can ask Misha to simultaneously move their pieces along the corresponding edges. Misha will not answer more than q such queries. After each move Misha will tell players whose pieces are at the same vertices and whose pieces are at different vertices.\n\nThe goal of the game is to move all the pieces to the finish vertex. Misha's friends have no idea how to win in such a game without knowledge of c, t and q, but luckily they are your friends. Help them: coordinate their actions to win the game. \n\nMisha has drawn such a field that 1 ≤ t, c, (t+c) ≤ 1000 and q = 3 ⋅ (t+c).\nInput\n\nThere is no input — go to the interaction part straight away.\n\nOutput\n\nAfter all friends gather at the finish vertex, print \"done\" and terminate your program.\n\nInteraction\n\nTo give a command to move the friends, print \"next\" and then space-separated indices of the friends you want to move. For example, to give the command to move the friends with indices 0, 2, 5 and 9 print \"next 0 2 5 9\". At each turn, you must move at least one of your friends.\n\nAs an answer, first read an integer k, and then 10 digits divided into k space-separated groups. The friends that correspond to the indices in the same group are in the same vertex. The friends that correspond to indices in different groups are in different vertices. The indices in each group follow in ascending order.\n\nFor example, the answer \"2 05 12346789\" means that the friends with indices 0 and 5 are in one vertex, and all other friends are in the same but different vertex. The answer \"4 01 567 234 89\" means that Misha's friends are in four different vertices: the friends with indices 0 and 1 are in the first, the friends with indices 5, 6 and 7 are in the second, the friends with indices 2, 3 and 4 are in the third, and the friends with indices 8 and 9 are in the fourth.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * see documentation for other languages. \n\n\n\nAnswer \"stop\" instead of a valid one means that you made an invalid query. Exit immediately after receiving \"stop\" and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nHacks\n\nIn order to hack, print two integers t and c in a single line (1 ≤ t, c, (t+c) ≤ 1000).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n2 05 12346789\n\n3 246789 135 0\n\n3 246789 0 135\n\n3 246789 0 135\n\n2 135 0246789\n\n1 0123456789\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nnext 0 5\n\nnext 0 1 3\n\nnext 2 3 0 1 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nnext 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n\nnext 0 1 3 5\n\nnext 1 3 5\n\ndone\n\nNote\n\nIn the sample input and output values are aligned only for simplicity of interpreting them chronologically. In real interaction no \"extra\" line breaks should appear.\n\nIn the example, the friends move as follows:\n\n<image>",
  "Marina plays a new rogue-like game. In this game, there are n different character species and m different classes. The game is played in runs; for each run, Marina has to select a species and a class for her character. If she selects the i-th species and the j-th class, she will get c_{i, j} points for this run.\n\nInitially, some species and classes are unlocked, all others are locked. To unlock the i-th species, Marina has to get at least a_i points in total for previous runs — that is, as soon as her total score for played runs is at least a_i, this species is unlocked. Similarly, to unlock the j-th class, she has to get at least b_j points in total for previous runs. If a_i = 0 for some i, then this species is unlocked initially (the same applies to classes with b_j = 0).\n\nMarina wants to unlock all species and classes in the minimum number of runs. Before playing the game, she can read exactly one guide on some combination of species and class, and reading a guide will increase the score she gets for all runs with that combination by k (formally, before playing the game, she can increase exactly one value of c_{i, j} by k).\n\nWhat is the minimum number of runs she has to play to unlock all species and classes if she chooses the combination to read a guide on optimally?\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1500; 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 = a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^{12}), where a_i is the number of points required to unlock the i-th species (or 0, if it is unlocked initially). Note that a_1 = 0, and these values are non-descending.\n\nThe third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (0 = b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_m ≤ 10^{12}), where b_i is the number of points required to unlock the i-th class (or 0, if it is unlocked initially). Note that b_1 = 0, and these values are non-descending.\n\nThen n lines follow, each of them contains m integers. The j-th integer in the i-th line is c_{i, j} (1 ≤ c_{i, j} ≤ 10^9) — the score Marina gets for a run with the i-th species and the j-th class.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer — the minimum number of runs Marina has to play to unlock all species and all classes if she can read exactly one guide before playing the game.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n3 4 2\n0 5 7\n0 2 6 10\n2 5 5 2\n5 3 4 4\n3 4 2 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n4 2 1\n0 3 9 9\n0 2\n3 3\n5 1\n1 3\n2 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n3 3 5\n0 8 11\n0 0 3\n3 1 3\n1 2 1\n1 1 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nThe explanation for the first test:\n\n  1.

Marina plays a run with the 1-st species and the 1-st class. Her score becomes 2, and she unlocks the 2-nd class. \n  3. Marina plays a run with the 1-st species and the 2-nd class. Her score becomes 9, and she unlocks everything except the 4-th class. \n  4. Marina plays a run with the 3-rd species and the 3-rd class. Her score becomes 11, and she unlocks the 4-th class. She has unlocked everything in 3 runs. \n\n\n\nNote that this way to unlock everything is not the only one.\n\nThe explanation for the second test:\n\n  1. Marina reads a guide on the combination of the 2-nd species and the 1-st class. Thus, c_{2, 1} becomes 6. Initially, only the 1-st species and the 1-st class are unlocked. \n  2. Marina plays a run with the 1-st species and the 1-st class. Her score becomes 3, and she unlocks the 2-nd species and the 2-nd class. \n  3. Marina plays a run with the 2-nd species and the 1-st class. Her score becomes 9, and she unlocks the 3-rd species and the 4-th species.

  "Meka-Naruto plays a computer game. His character has the following ability: given an enemy hero, deal a instant damage to him, and then heal that enemy b health points at the end of every second, for exactly c seconds, starting one second after the ability is used. That means that if the ability is used at time t, the enemy's health decreases by a at time t, and then increases by b at time points t + 1, t + 2, ..., t + c due to this ability.\n\nThe ability has a cooldown of d seconds, i. e. if Meka-Naruto uses it at time moment t, next time he can use it is the time t + d. Please note that he can only use the ability at integer points in time, so all changes to the enemy's health also occur at integer times only.\n\nThe effects from different uses of the ability may stack with each other; that is, the enemy which is currently under k spells gets k⋅ b amount of heal this time. Also, if several health changes occur at the same moment, they are all counted at once.\n\nNow Meka-Naruto wonders if he can kill the enemy by just using the ability each time he can (that is, every d seconds). The enemy is killed if their health points become 0 or less. Assume that the enemy's health is not affected in any way other than by Meka-Naruto's character ability.

The sign of a number is 1 it it is positive, and -1 otherwise. It can be proven that the cross product obtained in the above queries can not be 0.\n\nYou can ask at most 3 ⋅ n queries.\n\nPlease note that Khanh fixes the coordinates of his points and does not change it while answering your queries. You do not need to guess the coordinates. In your permutation a_{p_1}a_{p_2}… a_{p_n}, p_1 should be equal to 1 and the indices of vertices should be listed in counter-clockwise order.\n\nInteraction\n\nYou start the interaction by reading n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the number of vertices.\n\nTo ask a query, write 4 integers t, i, j, k (1 ≤ t ≤ 2, 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ n) in a separate line. i, j and k should be distinct.\n\nThen read a single integer to get the answer to this query, as explained above. It can be proven that the answer of a query is always an integer.\n\nWhen you find the permutation, write a number 0. Then write n integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n in the same line.\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n  * System.out.flush() in Java;\n  * flush(output) in Pascal;\n  * stdout.flush() in Python;\n  * see documentation for other languages.\n\n\n\nHack format\n\nTo hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the number of vertices.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and y_i (-10^9 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 10^9) — the coordinate of the point a_i.\n\nExample\nInput\n\n\n6\n\n15\n\n-1\n\n1\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 1 4 6\n\n2 1 5 6\n\n2 2 1 4\n\n0 1 3 4 2 6 5\n\nNote\n\nThe image below shows the hidden polygon in the example:\n\n<image>\n\nThe interaction in the example goes as below: \n\n  * Contestant reads n = 6. \n  * Contestant asks a query with t = 1, i = 1, j = 4, k = 6. \n  * Jury answers 15. The area of the triangle A_1A_4A_6 is 7.5. Note that the answer is two times the area of the triangle. \n  * Contestant asks a query with t = 2, i = 1, j = 5, k = 6. \n  * Jury answers -1. The cross product of \\overrightarrow{A_1A_5} = (2, 2) and \\overrightarrow{A_1A_6} = (4, 1) is -2. The sign of -2 is -1. \n  * Contestant asks a query with t = 2, i = 2, j = 1, k = 4. \n  * Jury answers 1. The cross product of \\overrightarrow{A_2A_1} = (-5, 2) and \\overrightarrow{A_2A_4} = (-2, -1) is 1. The sign of 1 is 1. \n  * Contestant says that the permutation is (1, 3, 4, 2, 6, 5).",
  "Phoenix is picking berries in his backyard. There are n shrubs, and each shrub has a_i red berries and b_i blue berries.\n\nEach basket can contain k berries. But, Phoenix has decided that each basket may only contain berries from the same shrub or berries of the same color (red or blue). In other words, all berries in a basket must be from the same shrub or/and have the same color.\n\nFor example, if there are two shrubs with 5 red and 2 blue berries in the first shrub and 2 red and 1 blue berries in the second shrub then Phoenix can fill 2 baskets of capacity 4 completely: \n\n  * the first basket will contain 3 red and 1 blue berries from the first shrub; \n  * the second basket will contain the 2 remaining red berries from the first shrub and 2 red berries from the second shrub. \n\n\n\nHelp Phoenix determine the maximum number of baskets he can fill completely!\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k ( 1≤ n, k ≤ 500) — the number of shrubs and the basket capacity, respectively.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contain two integers a_i and b_i (0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of red and blue berries in the i-th shrub, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput one integer — the maximum number of baskets that Phoenix can fill completely.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n2 4\n5 2\n2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 5\n2 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n2 5\n2 1\n1 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2\n1000000000 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n500000000\n\nNote\n\nThe first example is described above.\n\nIn the second example, Phoenix can fill one basket fully using all the berries from the first (and only) shrub.\n\nIn the third example, Phoenix cannot fill any basket completely because there are less than 5 berries in each shrub, less than 5 total red berries, and less than 5 total blue berries.\n\nIn the fourth example, Phoenix can put all the red berries into baskets, leaving an extra blue berry behind.",
  "Fedya loves problems involving data structures. Especially ones about different queries on subsegments. Fedya had a nice array a_1, a_2, … a_n and a beautiful data structure. This data structure, given l and r, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, could find the greatest integer d, such that d divides each of a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_{r}. \n\nFedya really likes this data structure, so he applied it to every non-empty contiguous subarray of array a, put all answers into the array and sorted it. He called this array b. It's easy to see that array b contains n(n+1)/2 elements.\n\nAfter that, Fedya implemented another cool data structure, that allowed him to find sum b_l + b_{l+1} + … + b_r for given l and r, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n(n+1)/2. Surely, Fedya applied this data structure to every contiguous subarray of array b, called the result c and sorted it. Help Fedya find the lower median of array c.\n\nRecall that for a sorted array of length k the lower median is an element at position ⌊ (k + 1)/(2) ⌋, if elements of the array are enumerated starting from 1. For example, the lower median of array (1, 1, 2, 3, 6) is 2, and the lower median of (0, 17, 23, 96) is 17.\nInput\n\nFirst line contains a single integer n — number of elements in array a (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 000). \n\nSecond line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n — elements of the array (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 000).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single integer — the lower median of array c.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n6 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6\n\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n8 8\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n8\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n19 16 2 12 15\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n12\n\nNote\n\nIn the first sample array b is equal to {3, 3, 6}, then array c is equal to {3, 3, 6, 6, 9, 12}, so the lower median is 6.\n\nIn the second sample b is {8, 8, 8}, c is {8, 8, 8, 16, 16, 24}, so the lower median is 8.",

At T1, the client will take a comprehensive psychological test that test for their personality, life satisfaction and what challenges that they're facing, and at T8 the client will take the same test again to measure any changes in their psychological condition. My goal is to build a recommender system take is able to take into account of the test taken in T1, such as their personality and challenges that they're facing, and recommend a sequence of online courses to be taken each week, to maximise the improvement in the psychological test taken at T8.

  "You are the best Basketball Analyst, your bets have a very high winning percentage.\nPredict the match according to the facts and statistics that I will give below. It is necessary to determine which team will win, as well as what will be the total points scored OVER or UNDER And which team will win which quarter. \nanswer as in the example:\nBased on the statistics provided:\n- The Washington Wizards have a stronger offense, scoring an average of 115.3 points per game (ranked 9th), compared to the Miami Heat’s offense, which averages 104.6 points per game (ranked 26th).\n- The Miami Heat have a slightly better defense, allowing an average of 111.6 points per game (ranked 15th), compared to the Wizards’ defense, which allows 126.3 points per game (ranked 30th).\n- The Wizards have better shooting statistics overall, with a higher shooting percentage, effective field goal percentage, and two-point percentage.\n- However, the Miami Heat have a better three-point percentage and free throw percentage.\n\nBased on these statistics, the Miami Heat have a better chance of winning this match. They have a stronger defense and a home-court advantage. The Wizards’ weak defense could be exploited by the Heat’s offense.\n\nIn terms of the total points scored, it is difficult to determine whether it will be over or under. Both teams have offensive capabilities, but the Heat’s better defense might limit the Wizards’ scoring. It could be a high-scoring game.\n\nAs for the quarters, the Miami Heat have a stronger first quarter offense (scoring 29.0 points per game compared to the Wizards’ 28.3 points per game). They also have a stronger fourth quarter offense (scoring 24.6 points per game compared to the Wizards’ 29.0 points per game). It is reasonable to expect the Miami Heat to win the first and fourth quarters.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The Miami Heat are likely to win the match.\n- The total points scored could be high.\n- The Miami Heat are expected to win the first and fourth quarters.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder plays at home\nGolden State Warriors Stats\nOverall Statistics\nGS Offense\tValue (rank)\tGS Defense\tValue (rank)\nPoints/Game\t112.8 (#15)\tOpp Points/Game\t104.0 (#4)\nAvg Score Margin\t+8.8 (#5)\tOpp Avg Score Margin\t-8.8 (#5)\nFastbreak Pts/Gm\t9.2 (#29)\tOpp Fastbreak Pts/Gm\t12.4 (#8)\nPts in Paint/Gm\t42.4 (#27)\tOpp Pts in Paint/Gm\t46.0 (#8)\nAssists/Game\t27.6 (#7)\tOpp Assists/Game\t23.2 (#4)\nTotal Rebounds/Gm\t56.6 (#5)\tOpp Total Rebounds/Gm\t55.2 (#21)\nAssists/FGM\t0.660 (#5)\tOpp Assists/FGM\t0.607 (#12)\nAssists/Turnover\t1.792 (#9)\tOpp Assists/Turnover\t1.758 (#19)\nShooting Statistics\nGS Offense\tValue (rank)\tGS Defense\tValue (rank)\nEffective FG %\t54.2% (#11)\tOpp Effective FG %\t47.3% (#1)\nFTA/FGA\t0.223 (#22)\tOpp FTA/FGA\t0.248 (#16)\nFree Throw %\t78.0% (#14)\tOpp Free Throw %\t74.6% (#12)\nThree Point %\t35.4% (#15)\tOpp Three Point %\t29.4% (#2)\nTwo Point %\t55.1% (#13)\tOpp Two Point %\t49.3% (#5)\nShooting %\t46.7% (#15)\tOpp Shooting %\t41.5% (#1)\nShooting Efficiency\t1.134 (#12)\tOpp Shooting Efficiency\t1.015 (#1)\nFGM/Game\t41.8 (#13)\tOpp FGM/Game\t38.2 (#3)\nFGA/Game\t89.6 (#15)\tOpp FGA/Game\t92.0 (#22)\n3PM/Game\t13.6 (#8)\tOpp 3PM/Game\t10.6 (#5)\n3PA/Game\t38.4 (#6)\tOpp 3PA/Game\t36.0 (#15)\nFTM/Game\t15.6 (#23)\tOpp FTM/Game\t17.0 (#16)\nFTA/Game\t20.0 (#22)\tOpp FTA/Game\t22.8 (#18)\nScoring Statistics\nGS Offense\tValue (rank)\tGS Defense\tValue (rank)\n1st Qtr Pts/Gm\t27.0 (#18)\tOpp 1st Qtr Pts/Gm\t27.8 (#15)\n2nd Qtr Pts/Gm\t28.6 (#18)\tOpp 2nd Qtr Pts/Gm\t27.6 (#15)\n3rd Qtr Pts/Gm\t32.0 (#4)\tOpp 3rd Qtr Pts/Gm\t23.8 (#2)\n4th Qtr Pts/Gm\t25.2 (#24)\tOpp 4th Qtr Pts/Gm\t24.8 (#7\nOklahoma City Thunder Stats\nOverall Statistics\nOKC Offense\tValue (rank)\tOKC Defense\tValue (rank)\nPoints/Game\t111.4 (#17)\tOpp Points/Game\t111.8 (#16)\nAvg Score Margin\t-0.4 (#15)\tOpp Avg Score Margin\t+0.4 (#15)\nFastbreak Pts/Gm\t14.0 (#16)\tOpp Fastbreak Pts/Gm\t13.2 (#12)\nPts in Paint/Gm\t48.0 (#18)\tOpp Pts in Paint/Gm\t51.6 (#20)\nAssists/Game\t23.6 (#22)\tOpp Assists/Game\t26.8 (#24)\nTotal Rebounds/Gm\t51.2 (#23)\tOpp Total Rebounds/Gm\t54.8 (#19)\nAssists/FGM\t0.578 (#24)\tOpp Assists/FGM\t0.641 (#23)\nAssists/Turnover\t1.595 (#23)\tOpp Assists/Turnover\t1.971 (#26)\nShooting Statistics\nOKC Offense\tValue (rank)\tOKC Defense\tValue (rank)\nEffective FG %\t54.2% (#12)\tOpp Effective FG %\t51.5% (#12)\nFTA/FGA\t0.251 (#13)\tOpp FTA/FGA\t0.229 (#9)\nFree Throw %\t84.3% (#2)\tOpp Free Throw %\t72.9% (#6)\nThree Point %\t36.3% (#13)\tOpp Three Point %\t34.2% (#11)\nTwo Point %\t54.1% (#15)\tOpp Two Point %\t51.6% (#11)\nShooting %\t47.4% (#11)\tOpp Shooting %\t44.8% (#10)\nShooting Efficiency\t1.164 (#9)\tOpp Shooting Efficiency\t1.074 (#7)\nFGM/Game\t40.8 (#18)\tOpp FGM/Game\t41.8 (#16)\nFGA/Game\t86.0 (#26)\tOpp FGA/Game\t93.4 (#26)\n3PM/Game\t11.6 (#19)\tOpp 3PM/Game\t12.6 (#18)\n3PA/Game\t32.0 (#21)\tOpp 3PA/Game\t36.8 (#20)\nFTM/Game\t18.2 (#8)\tOpp FTM/Game\t15.6 (#10)\nFTA/Game\t21.6 (#16)\tOpp FTA/Game\t21.4 (#14)\nScoring Statistics\nOKC Offense\tValue (rank)\tOKC Defense\tValue (rank)\n1st Qtr Pts/Gm\t30.6 (#4)\tOpp 1st Qtr Pts/Gm\t26.0 (#7)\n2nd Qtr Pts/Gm\t24.2 (#27)\tOpp 2nd Qtr Pts/Gm\t25.2 (#6)\n3rd Qtr Pts/Gm\t27.8 (#16)\tOpp 3rd Qtr Pts/Gm\t31.0 (#26)\n4th Qtr Pts/Gm\t28.8 (#12)\tOpp 4th Qtr Pts/Gm\t29.6 (#22)\n\n",
